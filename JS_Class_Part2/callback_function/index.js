// //What are callback function in JAVASCRIPT:
// setTimeout(function(){
//     console.log("Timer");
// }, 3000);

// function x(y){
//     console.log("This is X function");
//     y();
// }

// x(function y(){
//     console.log("This is Y function");
// })
// // console.log("Wait");

// //In JS is synchronous and single threaded means it will execute 1 line at a time.
// //Js has single call stack/ main thread. Everything excuted inside the page will executed through the callstack
// //                  "SO"
// //If any heavy operation will take more time to excute like (20- 30secs),by the time JS has only 1 call stack so it won't be able to execute anyother function in the code it will block the main thread/call stack called as blocking the main thread

// //To avoid blocking the main thread -- we go for asynchronous behaviour just like we did with setTimeOut()
// //setTimeOut will take the call back and will execute this piece of code somewhere else and it will empty the call stack and get out of the call stack.
// //Using WebAPIs (setTimeOut) + callback = we can achieve the asynchronous behaviour.

//Asynchronous code is always executed after the main thread
//Never trust the delay given to the setTimeout function. You can only specify a minimum delay. Even if you set a 0 delay, your code could be executed much later.

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("I am an asynchronous message");
}); // You can omit the 0

console.log("Test 1");

for (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
  console.log(doSomeStuff());
}

console.log("Test 2");

// The 'I am an asynchronous message' will be displayed when the main thread reach here

function doSomeStuff() {
  return "Function doSomestuff";
}

//setInterval
//setInterval has the same behavior as setTimeout but the code is executed multiple times.
//You have to call clearInterval to kill the timer.

let counter = 0;

let timer = setInterval(function () {
  console.log("I am an asynchronous message");

  counter += 1;

  if (counter >= 5) {
    clearInterval(timer);
  }
}, 1000);

console.log("I am a synchronous message");

//With more and more asynchronous code and features in recent frameworks, we need something to manage it. Here comes our savior: the Promise class.
//It is now the standard way to deal with asynchronous code
